# Description
Monitors notifications from user-selected apps and sends them to Android Auto.

Root is *optional*, solely used to list apps of other users (profiles) to obtain their info conveniently. However, no root is needed to monitor notifications for any app, including those of other users. To add an app of other users without root, use the "enter app info" button to enter its package name and user id manually.

# Features
- Dismiss the original notification when interacted on Android Auto.
- Works for other users (profiles).
